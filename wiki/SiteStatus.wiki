 * `"onmousedown"`-handler that rewrites the result links. Turning !JavaScript off disables this, but also most of the functionality.
 * Unfortunately, document clicks are handled by event listeners, that have to be prevented. This breaks the formatted results (bold words in the link), so formatting had to be removed.
 
== Mail: https://mail.google.com ==
 * External links in mails don't seem to get tracked :-)

== News: http://news.google.com ==
 * An event listener checks for the class `"_tracked"` and doesn't try to redirect if present.

== Documents: https://docs.google.com ==
 * Not tested.

== Search: http://search.yahoo.com ==
 * A _capturing_ event listener does background ping home, as soon as the mouse goes down on the link. Adding our own capturing listener really slows things down!

== Mail: https://mail.google.com ==
 * Also here, extern links in mails seem OK.

== My Yahoo! http://my.yahoo.com ==
 * External links there usually open a reader panel, that will of course be tracked. Preventing this looses some of the convenience of this portal.

== News: http://news.yahoo.com ==
 * Yahoo! has its own big news service, so almost all of the links on the portal point to Yahoo! pages. So of course, they know what you're clicking ;-)
