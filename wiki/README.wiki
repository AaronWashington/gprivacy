= About =
[http://code.google.com/p/gprivacy/ gprivacy] is an add-on for
[http://www.seamonkey-project.org/ SeaMonkey] and
[http://www.mozilla.com/firefox/ Firefox], that tries make certain popular
websites respect the browser's
[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Do_not_track_header DNT (Do Not Track) flag].

`gprivacy` works by adding a cleaned-up link to every link that it recognizes
as having tracking functionality.

== Another Disclaimer ==
  `gprivacy` does not -- and cannot -- recognize every mechanism companies use
  to track user behavior! In fact, this will be probably a losing battle.

  With every redesign of a website, tracking mechanisms change, and `gprivacy` *will
  definitely* become obsolete rather sooner than later. For our most used websites,
  We will try to keep this add-on as up-to-date as possible, but some others may
  fall through the cracks...
  
  If you find that a website is starting to track you again or that `gprivacy`
  is causing errors on a page, please head over to the [#Support support section]
  and find our contact addresses.

  If on the other hand, you want to help out and extend `gprivacy`, see what
  [#Developers developers can do]!

= Options =
http://gprivacy.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/screens/grpivacy-options.default.jpg

==== General ====
  * *Privacy active* - Switch `gprivacy` on or off.
  * *Replace original links* - Instead of adding a link, replace the existing one.
  * *Show original links* - If replaced, add the infested link too.
  * *Mark modified links* - Mark links with small icons (http://gprivacy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/chrome/skin/private.png, http://gprivacy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/chrome/skin/tracking.png)
  * *Show descriptive text* - Add '`private`' or '`tracked`' to the appended links. Either this or the previous option _must_ be set.

==== Website Options ====
  * *Own links allowed* - Links to the same website will not be modified. This prevents the cluttering of some websites by sacrificing a little privacy. This is usually not a problem, as the links target is clearly visible in the browsers status, and the website can register the click anyway.
  * *All Clicks http://gprivacy.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/chrome/skin/attention.png * - Try to catch *`*`every`*`* click on recognized links, and block it. Use this only, if you don't trust a website, as this might impair its functionality!

==== Advanced Options ====

You should leave this options as is, unless asked by the developers to
change them!

 * *Mark empty and !JavaScript links * - In combination with *All Clicks*, this blocks almost every possibility for website to track clicks. But it also almost certainly completely breaks it! You might as well use [https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/addon/noscript/ NoScript] or turn !JavaScript off completely. That's probably safer.
 * *Debug output to console* - Write verbose output to the browsers error console. On large websites, this might severely impact performance.

= Support =
`gprivacy`'s support e-mail address can be found on the
[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/addon/google-privacy/ Add-On Site]
(beside the _About this Add-on_ section).

`gprivacy` is extensible! If you know a website that violates peoples privacy
but offers otherwise useful content - And you know how to create add-ons for
Mozilla products, head over to the [Developers Developer Page]!
