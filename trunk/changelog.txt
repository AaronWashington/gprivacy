Google, YouTube, Yahoo!, Bing, Facebook and probably many other websites are trying to hide the fact that are tracking your clicks, even if you tell them not to.

They're doing this, sometimes by replacing the links as soon as press the mouse-button sometimes by adding other click handlers.

This means that even if you drag the seemingly harmless links to another tab or copy and paste the link, you still get tracked.


To see this effect (and for security reasons), I'd recommend you to install the excellent <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US//addon/requestpolicy/">RequestPolicy</a> add-on!
